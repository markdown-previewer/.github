## About

The goal of this organization is to provide:

- A clean, distraction-free space to write and preview Markdown.
- Tools that work entirely in the browser using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Features that feel familiar to developers and writers who use GitHub-flavored Markdown.

The main app currently includes:

- Live Markdown editor with split-view preview
- GitHub-flavored Markdown (tables, task lists, fenced code blocks)
- Syntax highlighting for code blocks
- Dark/Light mode with preference saved locally
- Open and save `.md` files
- Export to standalone HTML or PDF (via browser print)
- Automatic local autosave (no data sent to a server)

Everything is free to use and open to the public.
